    <p>I was born in India and came to U.S. when I was 16. I graduated with a B.S in Operations Management
        Information Systems.
        After working in management for 10+ years, I wanted to make a career in Technology so I joined We Can
        Code IT bootcamp and became a software Engineer.
        In addition to my work and achievements, I love traveling, movies, going out with friends, and spending
        time with my family. Due to my interest in diversity
        and different cultures, have made me fluent in four languages.
